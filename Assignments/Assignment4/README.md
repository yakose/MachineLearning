# Assignment 4: BI Clients & Visualization

## Task

  1. Acquire and install your choice of BI-reporting tool Client (Tableau or Power BI Desktop). NB: Power BI Dekstop does not come in Mac/Linux flavor.

  2. Get an account on the Azure portal -- using you Cphbusiness credentials. 

  3. Set up a SQL server and database in Azure, be careful about resources, so you don't spend a lot of money there.

  4. Import your boliga data into a table in the Database, with the longitude and latitude columns included -- you did this is assignment 2. This can be done in several ways, one is to download SQL Server Management Studio (on one of the group's windows machines).

  5. Set access restrictions hard enough that you can access the database yourself on a single IP number (or narrow range). 

  6. Connect to the database from your BI Client tool, check that you can read the data OK by extracting the first 100 lines from the database table.

  7. Create a map of Denmark, where you plot the location of housing sales on the map. 

  8. Enhance the figure with more visual information, to support conclusions about sales prices, date of sales, etc. Get as much information into the plot as possible without cluttering the Map. How many dimensions can your visualization accommodate? I think about 4, if you use dots on the map, yes?

  9. Save your BI Client project and submit it to GitHub. Also submit a README.md with explanation of how to load the project. Also submit a screenshot of your BI Client showing the Map with the sales visualized from item 8 above.

  7. **Freestyle** Create a plot, which visualizes a fact hidden in the housing sales data, which you want to highlight to business people.
